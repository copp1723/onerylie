Absolutely. Here are **mock 2nd and 3rd customer replies** for each scenario, adding layers of complexity—misspellings, slang, vague statements, negative sentiment, and “difficult customer” behavior—to help you robustly train Rylie for edge cases and nuanced situations.

### 1. **Equity Offer – Edge Case Replies**

**Customer (1st reply):**
“Hey, I didn’t realize my car had any equity. What does that actually mean for me? I’m not sure if I want a new car but maybe if my payment wouldn’t go up a lot. Can you tell me what my options are?”

**Customer (2nd reply):**
“ok but u guys always say ‘little to no money down’ then i come in and they tell me i need 3 grand lol. not tryin to waste my time. can u actually tell me real numbers this time??”

**Customer (3rd reply, frustrated):**
“idk if i even wanna do this. last dealer said same thing then tried bait n switch. is this for real or just another ad? be straight w me plz.”

### 2. **Lease Maturity – Edge Case Replies**

**Customer (1st reply):**
“Yeah I got your message about my lease ending soon. What do I need to do? Can I just drop off the car or do I have to set up an appointment first? Not sure if I want to lease again or maybe buy this time.”

**Customer (2nd reply, unclear intent):**
“yo i lost the extra key and i got a scratch on the bumper is that a big deal or nah? i dnt want like a million fees lol. also im moving next month so not sure if i can bring it back in time.”

**Customer (3rd reply, agitated):**
“wait so if i turn in the car late am i gettin charged? i been gettin different answers every time i call, nobody knows what’s goin on. i just wanna know what’s actually gonna happen.”

### 3. **Overdue Service – Edge Case Replies**

**Customer (1st reply):**
“Thanks for reminding me! I’ve been putting it off. Is there a way to get a loaner car if my service takes a while? Also, what’s the earliest you could fit me in on a Saturday?”

**Customer (2nd reply, misspelling):**
“my car keeps makein a weird sound when i turn left, but i dont got time to sit around all day. u sure u got loner cars? last time yall were out. also i work nights so i sleep most saturdays.”

**Customer (3rd reply, frustrated):**
“man i called last week n got bounced around to like 3 ppl. do i gotta talk to service or what? jus wanna get my car fixed n go. u guys always got me on hold smh.”

### 4. **Lost Lead – Edge Case Replies**

**Customer (1st reply):**
“Oh hey, yeah I was looking but just got busy with work and never came back. I’m still interested if you have anything with AWD under \$25k. Do you have any specials or new arrivals that fit what I was looking for?”

**Customer (2nd reply, noncommittal):**
“honestly i was just browsing. idk if i’m ready to buy, prices seem wild rn. u got anything cheaper than what’s on ur site? also i gotta get rid of my old car first.”

**Customer (3rd reply, slang/vague):**
“yo tbh last time i came by the sales dude kept pushin all this warranty stuff n i bounced. not tryna deal with that again. what u got that’s no bs? just want a straight deal no hassle.”

### 5. **Trade-In Value – Edge Case Replies**

**Customer (1st reply):**
“I’ve been thinking about trading in but not sure if now’s the right time. Can you give me a rough idea of what my truck’s worth without me coming in? It’s got about 120k miles but I’ve kept up with all the maintenance.”

**Customer (2nd reply, slang):**
“lol yall always lowballin ppl tho. my buddy got like 3k less than kbb last time he came in. i don’t got time for games so if u got a real number lmk. also the A/C just started actin up, dunno if that matters.”

**Customer (3rd reply, frustrated/disgruntled):**
“whatever, last time i did this i drove an hour and then the offer dropped by \$1500 ‘for condition.’ feels like a scam. not tryna get played again. can u actually give me a straight up answer or nah?”

### 6. **Service Satisfaction – Edge Case Replies**

**Customer (1st reply):**
“Yeah the service was good, thanks. Only thing is the waiting area was kind of crowded when I was there. The guy who checked me in was great though.”

**Customer (2nd reply, misspelling/critique):**
“nah the wifi barely worked and it took way longer than u said. i hadda be somewhere but no1 updated me. can yall text me next time if it’s gonna be late?”

**Customer (3rd reply, negative):**
“last time it was ok but 2 times ago i waited almost 3 hours just for an oil change. u guys keep tellin me different stuff every time. i dont even know if i wanna come back tbh.”

---

### 7. **Equity/Upgrade Offer – Edge Case Replies**

**Customer (1st reply):**
“That sounds pretty good. Are there any deals for people who are already customers? I don’t want my payment to go way up, but I’d consider upgrading if it makes sense.”

**Customer (2nd reply, negative/uncertain):**
“idk i seen ads before and when i went in it was nothing like what they said. do u got anything real for ppl like me or is it just for new customers? my payments gotta stay low or i can’t do it.”

**Customer (3rd reply, slang/frustrated):**
“bruh if u just gonna try to upsell me like the last guy don’t bother. i just want facts no bs. if i can get a better car for same payment, cool. if not, i’m good.”

### 8. **Lease Pull-Ahead – Edge Case Replies**

**Customer (1st reply):**
“I didn’t realize I could get out early. Will there be any penalties if I end my lease a few months before it’s up? How does that work?”

**Customer (2nd reply, unclear):**
“what if i just wanna swap to a bigger suv? my fam’s growin and i need more space but can’t really pay more. also my bumper got a dent. does that matter for turnin it in?”

**Customer (3rd reply, frustrated):**
“not tryna get stuck with a bunch of hidden fees like last time. every time i ask someone i get a diff answer. can someone actually tell me what’s up for real?”

---

### 9. **General Price Shopper – Edge Case Replies**

**Customer (1st reply):**
“I got a couple quotes from other places but haven’t made up my mind yet. If you can beat \$399 a month, I might be interested. What’s your best deal right now?”

**Customer (2nd reply, aggressive):**
“yeah but don’t play games. last time i came in yall added a bunch of fees i didn’t know about. i need the OTD price—no hidden stuff. u can do that or nah?”

**Customer (3rd reply, slang/misspelling):**
“tbh not tryna get hosed lol. just give me the real deal. dont wanna drive all the way if u just gonna add ‘dealer fees’ at the end. i’ll go somewhere else if it’s not what u say.”

### 10. **Service Special/Coupon – Edge Case Replies**

**Customer (1st reply):**
“I could probably use that soon, my brakes have been squeaking a bit. Do you guys offer shuttle service, or do I need to wait at the dealership?”

**Customer (2nd reply, vague):**
“last time yall said it’d be done in an hour n i waited 3. if i come in this week u really gonna get me out quick? gotta be at work by 1pm.”

**Customer (3rd reply, negative/disgruntled):**
“ngl last visit wasn’t great. i had to ask for my car twice and no1 seemed to know what was goin on. why should i come back this time?”
