# Maintenance Procedures

This document outlines routine maintenance procedures for the Rylie AI platform to ensure optimal performance, security, and reliability.

## Routine Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Frequency | Priority | Estimated Time |
|------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Database maintenance | Weekly | High | 1-2 hours |
| Log rotation verification | Weekly | Medium | 30 minutes |
| Security updates | Monthly | Critical | 2-4 hours |
| Dependency updates | Monthly | High | 2-3 hours |
| Cache performance review | Monthly | Medium | 1 hour |
| Database performance tuning | Quarterly | High | 3-4 hours |
| SSL certificate renewal | Annually | Critical | 1 hour |

## Database Maintenance

### Index Optimization

Run the following script to apply optimal indexes and analyze database performance:

```bash
# Run script to apply indexes
npm run scripts/apply-indexes.ts

# Analyze database performance
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "ANALYZE;"
```

### Database Vacuum

Regular vacuum operations help reclaim storage and update statistics:

```bash
# Run vacuum analyze on all tables
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "VACUUM ANALYZE;"

# For tables with high churn, run full vacuum
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "VACUUM FULL conversations;"
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "VACUUM FULL messages;"
```

### Connection Pool Monitoring

Check and optimize database connection pool:

```bash
# Check current connections
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';"

# Check connection wait times
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT max(now() - backend_start) AS max_conn_time FROM pg_stat_activity;"
```

## Log Management

### Log Analysis

Periodically analyze logs for error patterns:

```bash
# Find most common errors
grep ERROR /path/to/logs/*.log | cut -d: -f3- | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20

# Find recent errors
grep ERROR /path/to/logs/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)*.log

# Check API response times
grep "API request" /path/to/logs/*.log | grep -oP 'duration":"[^"]*' | cut -d: -f2 | sort -n
```

### Log Cleanup

While log rotation is automatic, periodically verify it's working:

```bash
# Check log directory size
du -sh /path/to/logs/

# Manually remove logs older than retention policy if needed
find /path/to/logs/ -name "*.log" -type f -mtime +30 -delete
```

## Security Maintenance

### Dependency Audit

Regularly check for vulnerabilities in dependencies:

```bash
# Check for vulnerable dependencies
npm audit

# Fix vulnerable dependencies (after testing)
npm audit fix
```

### API Key Rotation

Rotate API keys periodically for enhanced security:

1. Generate new API keys in external services (OpenAI, SendGrid)
2. Update environment variables with new keys
3. Verify functionality with new keys
4. Revoke old API keys after confirming new keys work

### Security Headers Verification

Verify security headers are properly configured:

```bash
# Check security headers using curl
curl -I https://yourdomain.com | grep -E "(Strict-Transport-Security|Content-Security-Policy|X-Frame-Options|X-XSS-Protection)"
```

## Performance Optimization

### Cache Efficiency

Monitor and optimize the caching system:

```bash
# Check cache statistics
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health/cache

# Clear cache if needed (via API endpoint or direct call)
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/cache/clear -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

### Memory Usage Monitoring

Monitor application memory usage:

```bash
# Check process memory usage
ps -o pid,rss,command -p $(pgrep -f "node.*server")

# Monitor memory usage over time
top -b -n 1 -p $(pgrep -f "node.*server") | tail -n 1
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Check Verification

Regularly verify monitoring systems are correctly checking health endpoints:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health

# Test cache health endpoint
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health/cache
```

### Alert Testing

Periodically test alerting mechanisms:

1. Temporarily modify health check threshold
2. Verify alert is triggered
3. Reset threshold to normal value

## Backup Verification

### Backup Testing

Regularly test backups to ensure they can be restored:

```bash
# Find latest backup
LATEST_BACKUP=$(ls -t /backups/database/rylie_full_*.dump.gz | head -1)

# Create test database
createdb rylie_backup_test

# Restore backup to test database
gunzip -c $LATEST_BACKUP | pg_restore --dbname=rylie_backup_test --no-owner

# Run validation queries
psql -d rylie_backup_test -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
psql -d rylie_backup_test -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM conversations;"

# Drop test database
dropdb rylie_backup_test
```

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variable Audit

Periodically review environment variables for security and correctness:

1. Check for hardcoded sensitive values
2. Verify all required variables are set
3. Remove any unused variables
4. Ensure production values are properly secured

## Update Procedures

### Node.js Version Update

When updating Node.js version:

1. Test application with new version in development
2. Update CI/CD pipelines to use new version
3. Update production environment
4. Verify application functionality after update

### Dependency Updates

Process for updating dependencies:

1. Create a dedicated branch for updates
2. Run `npm update` or update specific packages
3. Run all tests to verify compatibility
4. Address any breaking changes
5. Deploy to staging for thorough testing
6. Merge to main branch and deploy to production

## Emergency Maintenance

### Handling Critical Security Vulnerabilities

Process for addressing critical security issues:

1. Assess vulnerability impact and exposure
2. Apply temporary mitigation if possible
3. Prepare and test fix in isolated environment
4. Schedule emergency maintenance window
5. Apply fix to production with minimal downtime
6. Verify fix effectiveness
7. Document incident and response

### Handling Performance Emergencies

Steps to address sudden performance degradation:

1. Identify bottleneck using monitoring tools
2. Apply immediate mitigations (scaling, caching)
3. Analyze root cause using logs and metrics
4. Implement targeted fix
5. Monitor to ensure resolution

## Documentation Update

### Keeping Documentation Current

Ensure documentation reflects current system state:

1. Update documentation after significant changes
2. Review and update documentation quarterly
3. Keep API documentation synchronized with implementation
4. Update diagrams and architecture documents

## Compliance and Audit

### Regular Compliance Checks

Perform regular compliance reviews:

1. Verify data retention policies are enforced
2. Ensure user data is properly protected
3. Check that audit logs are comprehensive
4. Verify security controls are effective
