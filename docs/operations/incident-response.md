## Incident Detection

### Monitoring Alerts

The following monitoring alerts may indicate an incident:

- Health check failure
- Error rate spike (> 5% of requests)
- Abnormal response time (> 500ms average)
- Database connection failures
- Memory usage above 90%
- CPU usage above 80%
- Disk usage above 85%
- Unusual API usage patterns

### Manual Detection

Incidents may also be detected through:

- Customer reports
- Team member observations
- Security notifications
- External monitoring services

## Incident Response Process

### 1. Identification and Reporting

**Objective**: Recognize and report potential incidents quickly.

**Steps**:
1. Identify potential incident through monitoring or manual detection
2. Report to incident response team via designated channel
3. Assign initial severity level
4. Create incident ticket in tracking system

**Artifacts**:
- Initial incident report with timestamp and reporter
- Screenshots or logs showing the issue

### 2. Assessment and Triage

**Objective**: Determine incident scope, impact, and initial response.

**Steps**:
1. Confirm incident severity based on impact assessment
2. Designate Incident Commander
3. Assemble appropriate response team based on incident type
4. Determine if incident requires security escalation
5. Create incident communication channel

**Artifacts**:
- Updated incident report with severity and team assignment
- Initial impact assessment

### 3. Containment

**Objective**: Prevent incident from causing further damage.

**Steps**:
1. Identify containment strategies appropriate to the incident
2. Execute containment measures
3. Verify containment effectiveness

**Examples of containment measures**:
- Isolate affected systems
- Block suspicious IP addresses
- Disable compromised accounts
- Enable maintenance mode for affected components
- Roll back to last known good configuration

### 4. Investigation

**Objective**: Determine root cause and full impact.

**Steps**:
1. Collect and analyze relevant logs
2. Review recent changes and deployments
3. Analyze affected components
4. Document findings in real-time
5. Create timeline of events

**Investigation commands**:

```bash
# Check application logs
grep ERROR /path/to/logs/application-*.log

# Check recent database activity
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT query, query_start, state FROM pg_stat_activity ORDER BY query_start DESC LIMIT 20;"

# Check server resources
top -b -n 1

# Check disk usage
df -h

# Check recent API calls
grep "API request" /path/to/logs/application-*.log | tail -50

# Check for security events
grep "authentication\|authorization\|permission\|access" /path/to/logs/application-*.log
```

### 5. Remediation

**Objective**: Resolve the incident and restore normal operations.

**Steps**:
1. Develop remediation plan based on investigation findings
2. Document potential risks of remediation actions
3. Implement remediation with appropriate approvals
4. Verify remediation effectiveness
5. Restore normal operations

**Common remediation actions**:
- Restart application services
- Deploy emergency code fix
- Restore from backup
- Scale up resources
- Reconfigure components

### 6. Recovery

**Objective**: Return to normal operations and ensure stability.

**Steps**:
1. Monitor system to ensure stability
2. Gradually roll back any emergency measures
3. Restore any disabled functionality
4. Verify all components are functioning properly
5. Formally declare incident resolved

**Recovery verification**:
- Run comprehensive health checks
- Verify data integrity
- Test critical user journeys
- Confirm monitoring systems are operational

### 7. Post-Incident Activities

**Objective**: Learn from the incident and prevent recurrence.

**Steps**:
1. Conduct post-mortem meeting
2. Document root causes and contributing factors
3. Identify preventative measures
4. Create action items with owners and deadlines
5. Update documentation and procedures
6. Share lessons learned with the team

**Post-mortem template**:
- Incident summary
- Timeline of events
- Root cause analysis
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items

## Special Scenarios

### Security Incidents

For security incidents, additional steps include:

1. Involve security team immediately
2. Determine if external authorities need to be notified
3. Preserve evidence for forensic analysis
4. Follow data breach notification procedures if applicable
5. Conduct security review post-incident

### Database Incidents

For database-related incidents:

1. Assess data integrity
2. Determine if point-in-time recovery is needed
3. Verify replication status
4. Consider read-only mode during recovery
5. Validate data after recovery

### External Service Dependencies

For incidents involving external services:

1. Check service status pages
2. Contact vendor support if necessary
3. Implement fallback mechanisms if available
4. Consider rate limiting to prevent cascading failures
5. Document vendor response for future reference

## Incident Documentation

All incidents should be documented with:

1. Incident ID and severity
2. Start and end times
3. Detection method
4. Impact summary
5. Response timeline
6. Root cause analysis
