# Rylie AI Deployment Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for deploying the Rylie AI platform to a test or production environment.

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Requirements

### Database Setup
- [x] Create database tables
- [x] Configure sessions table for authentication
- [ ] Setup database indexes for performance
- [ ] Review database security settings

### Environment Variables
- [x] SESSION_SECRET configured
- [x] OPENAI_API_KEY configured
- [x] SENDGRID_API_KEY configured
- [x] REPLIT_DOMAINS configured
- [x] NODE_ENV configured

### Test Data
- [ ] Seed test dealership data
- [ ] Create sample vehicles inventory
- [ ] Configure test personas
- [ ] Setup sample admin accounts

### Security
- [ ] Configure CORS settings
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Setup authentication timeouts
- [ ] Configure input validation
- [ ] Review API access restrictions

## üöÄ Deployment Process

1. **Prepare Database**
   ```bash
   # Run database setup script
   npx tsx scripts/setup-database.ts
   
   # Create test data
   npx tsx scripts/test-setup.ts
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Check if all environment variables are set
   npx tsx scripts/check-env.ts
   ```

3. **Build Frontend Assets**
   ```bash
   # Build the frontend
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Start the Server**
   ```bash
   # Start the production server
   npm run start
   ```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] Verify authentication flows
- [ ] Test conversation initiation
- [ ] Confirm AI responses
- [ ] Validate handover triggers
- [ ] Test email delivery
- [ ] Confirm inventory search

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Check response times
- [ ] Monitor memory usage
- [ ] Verify database query performance
- [ ] Test under load (if applicable)

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Verify OpenAI connectivity
- [ ] Test SendGrid email delivery
- [ ] Validate authentication
- [ ] Test inventory management

## üõ†Ô∏è Known Issues & Workarounds

1. **Schema Discrepancy**
   - Issue: There's a mismatch between the schema definitions in code and actual database tables
   - Workaround: Use direct SQL queries for database operations until schema sync is complete

2. **Session Management**
   - Issue: Sessions table might not be properly initialized on first run
   - Workaround: Run `npx tsx scripts/setup-database.ts` before first server start

3. **Environment Variable Loading**
   - Issue: Environment variables might not load correctly in some environments
   - Workaround: Manually verify environment variables are loaded correctly at startup

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

In case of deployment failure:

1. Stop the server
2. Restore database from backup if any changes were made
3. Revert to previous code version
4. Restart the server with previous configuration

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Server response time
- API error rates
- Database connection pool usage
- Memory consumption
- OpenAI API usage and costs
- SendGrid email delivery rates

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Review and rotate API keys
- Monitor database size and performance
- Update dependencies for security patches
- Review server logs for errors or unusual patterns

## üìù Next Steps for Production Readiness

1. **Schema Synchronization**
   - Align schema definitions in code with actual database structure
   - Implement proper migration process

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Improve error logging and reporting
   - Implement graceful failure mechanisms

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement response compression

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Implement IP-based rate limiting
   - Review authentication flows for vulnerabilities

5. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Configure application performance monitoring
   - Set up automated alerts for critical failures
   - Implement usage analytics
